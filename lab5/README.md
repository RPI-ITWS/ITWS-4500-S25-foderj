# Plan 
   - Use D3
   - make one visualization of average temperature on run throughout time
   - another visualzation of Kudo Count throughout time 
   - Data Stored in Mongo will be conglomerate of weather and kudo information of every entry in 'db.json' 

---
# To do 
   - write a script to load the data I want into my Mongo
   - do some testing to see that I can pull from it correctly 
   - learn D3 and make visualizations correctly, 
   - add 2 endpoints to the API to return the visualization react endpoints 
      - get visualizations for all of the runs in the database  

---
# Description 
   - use either Rstudio or d3.js for data visualization 
      - prolly d3 cause new learning, but Rstudio would be quicker 
   - make a bar plot and a histogram if we use R 
      - can literally copy and paste into CSV
   - import runs to mongo and make visualization off of this.

# R studio Notes 
   - kina like C
   - have to output csv format, generate image, make a compenet

# D3 Resources 
   - https://d3-graph-gallery.com/intro_d3js.html
   - live and pull from the data base
