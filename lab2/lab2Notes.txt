make our API call other API's 
data that our server serves does not have to actually be on our server
'2 data sources' means one from your own JSON and another from that random other API 
Start making front end look nicer 

Inclass trial run: 
   make functions async and don't return api call until we get the weather data 

   log API fetch for test endpoing 

   Have to use our JSON objects for the post and put endpoints, but can just be a conglomerate of API's for the rest 

pagenation is just responding with a capped limit, not actually multiple pages
