Plan: 

   

   make our API call other API's 
   data that our server serves does not have to actually be on our server
   '2 data sources' means one from your own JSON and another from that random other API 
   Start making front end look nicer 

   Use weather API and Strava API 

   Change API to actually Paginate Responses of ID's 

   

Inclass trial run: 
   make functions async and don't return api call until we get the weather data 
      

Plan: 
   my new database is just going to be my strava runs from january but a much simplier JSON with not as much garbage, 
   Going to pull more info about the run ID from strava and weather data from historical weather API. 
   Get start, lat/long from strava -> use that to search the weather

   
Strava API NOtes: 
   what get mass activities, oldest is at bottom, and can paginate

Historical Weather API Notes:

Reqs: 
   Have to use our JSON objects for the post and put endpoints, but can just be a conglomerate of API's for the rest 

   you will need to have your endpoints make multiple
   API calls and combine the results into a singular JSON object before sending it back to your
   frontend.
   6 new get endpoints
      these endpoints must return JSON conglomerates from 2 API sources

   1 new post endpoint: 
      must add data from one external API to out 'db'

   1 new PUT endpoint: 
      update data in JSON (db) from one of external API's 

   Update documentation accordingly 

   frontend must parse data returned and display it nicely (have a raw/nice toggle) 

   Document API's I used 

Things I leaned: 
   pagenation is just responding with a capped limit, not actually multiple pages 

Before Submit: 
   Update docs of old and new endpoints

getting Strava: 
   need read all in order to list our activities 

Future Notes: 
   Add a .env so API's are called safely 
   add a strava ID and a 'my ID' 
   upgrate original PUTS/POSTS
