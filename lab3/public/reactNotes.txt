New thoughtprocess for making things: 
   reuse- UI elements 
   Not going to work on React and node working together

Frameworks:
   standard way to build and deploy web apps 
   learn how to think with frameworks (there are multiple) 
   makes codebases easier to naviagate with the introduction of components 

Data Binding: 
   html acts as a signpost of directives 
   Directives: adds behavior to DOM 
      Want to be reusable
   Components: Headers, buttons, forms ect
      written in js, shown as directive in html 
      Want to be reusable

Event delegation: 
   IS an event listener 

React start: 
   installed with this (like Jquery) 
   Props is short for properties 

   this is a directive: <div id="like-button-root"></div>
   Point of using react, to maximize minimizing writing code (multiple buttons, not one input box)
   react helps with logic 


Starting on Lab3: 

Things I learned: 
   one line function shortcut: () => fetchMe()
