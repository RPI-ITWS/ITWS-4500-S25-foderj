Things I've learned: 
 each 'document' in Mongo is a single stored (typically JSON)  element
 Technically stored in 'BSON', but can import JSON and Mongo will know what to do 
 Collection = table

Mongo DB Work: 
   basically an online DAtabase 


TO do: 
   Call external API from lab 3 100 times and loading it into mongo using compass 
   add error checking for verb and endpoint combinations 

Future Notes: 
   update DOCS


Server changes: 
   npm init -y  # Initialize a package.json if needed
   npm install mongodb
