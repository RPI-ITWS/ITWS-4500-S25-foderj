# Learning
   - Use RStudio visualization tool easy 
   - ETL -> Extract, Transform, and load
      - ETL pipeline: 
         - Extract data from external API's Transform that data in the way you want, load that DAta into mongoDB 
   - discoverability in terms of database outputs, make endpoints understandable and allow user to navigate entire API/Database intuitivley or with very helpful instructions 
   - Get data from a MongoDB via a Node API
      - literally our get endpoints that use mongo
   - Get data from external APIs via a Node API
      - literally our get endpoints that use external API's 
   - Know How to do a visualization. 

# To do
   - make react skeleton for quiz 

# My Big Things
   - make seperate page for visualizations

   - Automated ETL endpoint that pulls from external API, Transforms Data, and Loads it into Mongo DB all at once

   - Endpoint that connects to mongo DB and returns my top X longest runs in the database -> Just Distance, time and pace in good format

   - Endpoint that gets data from mongo in specific way I want it, so I can easily load it into Rstudio and make a visualization
